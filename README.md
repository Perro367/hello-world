I am an Argentinian Navy Officer👨‍✈️. I´m a Navy Pilot and I fly helicopters🚁. Pretty cool, right?
Nowadays, despite my achievements, I believe I can learn moore, so I started studying programming💻, cos I think It´s fascinating;
I like to solve puzzles🧩 and daily problems. I also love to read📕;
Each day ends with physical activity⚽🛶🏀🎾, cos It keeps balance⚖ between the body and the mind;
